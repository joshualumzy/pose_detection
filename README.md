# Pose Detection (Shoulder Angle) System

This project uses MediaPipe and OpenCV to detect human pose orientation (left or right side), plays voice feedback using gTTS and Pygame, and measures shoulder flexion angle.

## Features

- Real-time pose detection using webcam
- Voice feedback ("Left" / "Right")
- Shoulder flexion angle estimation
- Visibility checks for keypoints
- Live display of pose data
